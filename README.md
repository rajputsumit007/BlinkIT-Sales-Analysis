# BlinkIT-Sales-Analysis
📊 Blinkit Sales Performance Dashboard — Built using a tutorial from the Data Tutorial YouTube channel.
I'm super excited to share my latest work where I analyzed Blinkit’s sales data and visualized insights using Power BI. This hands-on project helped me understand the power of data storytelling and gave me the confidence to build more dashboards like a pro! 💪
🔍 Dashboard Highlights:

💰 Total Sales: $1.20 Million
📦 Number of Items: 8,523
⭐ Average Rating: 3.9
🛍️ Average Sales per Product: $141
📈 Outlet Establishment Trend (2010–2022): Peak growth in 2018 at $205K

🧠 Skills Applied:
✅ Used slicers for interactive filtering (Outlet Location, Size, Item Type)
 ✅ Designed KPI cards for high-level metrics
 ✅ Created donut and bar charts to compare fat content, outlet tiers, and item types
 ✅ Built a trend line chart for outlet growth over time
 ✅ Used table matrix for a detailed view of outlet types, total sales, visibility, and ratings
 ✅ Applied consistent color coding for intuitive visuals
 ✅ Maintained a clean and professional layout for easy interpretation

📊 Insights Discovered:
🏆 Tier 3 locations contributed the most item sales (3.35K)
🏪 Supermarket Type 1 dominated with $787.55K in sales and 5,577 items
🌱 Equal contribution from both Low Fat and Regular Fat items — reflecting balanced consumer choices
🛒 Top items by type include Meat, Household, Canned Foods, Breads — all consistently priced
📉 Slight dip in outlet establishments after 2018, possibly due to market saturation

🎯 What I Plan to Learn Next:
🔧 Implement DAX functions for custom calculations
 📆 Add Time Intelligence to analyze monthly/quarterly trends
 📤 Publish dashboards on Power BI Service for online access
 📚 Continue learning through Swayam NPTEL, LinkedIn Learning, and more YouTube tutorials
